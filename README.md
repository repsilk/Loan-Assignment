# Lending Club Case Study
> For a Consumer Finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicantâ€™s profile. In this project we use EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.

## General Information
> Like most other lending companies, lending loans to RISKY applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. The case study analyses the dataset for identification of RISKY applicants, that thereby cut-down the losses incurred by the lenders. The project performs univariate and bivariate analysis and establishes relationship between varibles to identify risks parameters.
